Those working in any capacity on a government\n    vessel are under the ultimate command of the ship's Commanding Officer (CO). In order to maintain safety and structure, those who board NOAA ships (and\n    partner chartered ships), must be willing to follow the orders of the CO. If following orders and protocol is something you think you may have trouble\n    with, this is not the program for you.\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eShipboard Policies\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n              \u003ca class\u003d\"textlink\" target\u003d\"_blank\" href\u003d\"http://www.moc.noaa.gov/all-ships/policy.html\"\u003eGeneral\n              Shipboard Policy Information\u003c/a\u003e contains useful information about\n              ship policies and procedures. \u0026nbsp;Some individual ship's pages\n              also have further information for visiting  teachers about life\n              aboard a ship. \u0026nbsp;One\n              site, supported by the Northeast Fisheries Science Center, has a \u003ca class\u003d\"textlink\" target\u003d\"_blank\" href\u003d\"http://www.nefsc.noaa.gov/femad/ecosurvey/mainpage/welcome_aboard.html\"\u003every\n              useful manual\u003c/a\u003e\n            for cruise volunteers and first-time sailors about life at sea. \u003cstrong\u003ePlease note that NOAA Teachers at Sea are not permitted under any circumstances to SCUBA dive even if he or she has been SCUBA certified. \u003c/strong\u003eIf you are interested in information about SCUBA diving, please visit the \u003ca class\u003d\"textlink\" target\u003d\"_blank\" href\u003d\"http://www.ndc.noaa.gov/\"\u003eNOAA Dive Center\u003c/a\u003e site.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"}},{"id":{"$t":"https://spreadsheets.google.com/feeds/list/0Ak_vKEBczgcYdGF0RG02ZzNHYzFRZnYwd3ZlNlRWcVE/1/public/values/cvlqs"},"updated":{"$t":"2014-09-30T22:49:20.838Z"},"category":[{"scheme":"http://schemas.google.com/spreadsheets/2006","term":"http://schemas.google.com/spreadsheets/2006#list"}],"title":{"type":"text","$t":"Would I be able to communicate with my students while at sea?"},"content":{"type":"text","$t":"answer: \u003cp\u003e\n             Teachers have the capacity to communicate with their students via blogs and e-mail while at sea, given the ship's satellite connection is functional (satellite connections are affected by weather).
