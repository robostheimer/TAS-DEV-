The Alumni assisted Jeannine Montgomery,
    Outreach Specialist from NOAA’s Office of Education, with hands-on activities. The public put their ideas about buoyancy to the test during the “Boat
    Building Challenge”. They had to design, build and load their boat to see how long it would float. Maker Faire participants also learned about how mariners
    and cultures from around the world began making rope out of natural fibers thousands of years ago and the engineering secrets that they discovered. They
    explored the strength of rope and unlocked some of these secrets by making ropes of their own in the “Rope Making Activity”. Over 750 families stopped by
    the NOAA booth to check out these activities!

			<description class="ng-binding">&lt;p&gt;
    &lt;a href="http://teacheratsea.noaa.gov/2012/frantz.html"&gt;Steven Frantz &lt;/a&gt;
    (TAS, 2012) was aboard NOAA ship &lt;em&gt;Oregon II’s 300&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;/em&gt;fishery and living marine resource missions during a shark longline survey in July
    2012. During this research mission, Mr. Frantz learned about a variety of sharks and one of the many ways he chose to share what he experienced was to
    create a shark card game. By playing the card game students learn about different species of sharks – what they look like, their scientific names, teeth
    shape and size. They also learn about the NOAA scientists and crew aboard NOAA ships. Mr. Frantz had the idea to create the cards but needed some talented
    illustrators to make the cards a reality. He asked two of his science students, Mai Lor and Norn Htaw, to illustrate the cards and they gladly accepted the
    opportunity.
&lt;/p&gt;

    Tim Cole, on their North Atlantic Right Whale surveys in the Gulf of Maine on June 23 – 27, 2014. Ellen saw a variety of marine life and whales from the
    air and gained a unique perspective from her previous experience on NOAA Ship &lt;em&gt;Delaware II&lt;/em&gt;, where she saw right whales from the ship. “To see these
    animals from the air is magnificent. You don’t get a sense of their size from a ship, where you might see a small part of the animal, but from the air you
    see so much more,” O’Donnell said of the flying experience as a Teacher in the Air.

&lt;strong&gt;Grade Level&lt;/strong&gt;
: 9-12
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Subject (Focus/Topic)&lt;/strong&gt;
: This lesson addresses the impacts that ocean acidification has on marine organisms, particularly those with calcium carbonate (CaCO3) shells.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Lesson Summary (Overview/Purpose)&lt;/strong&gt;
: Students will demonstrate how CaCO3 forms protective shells for marine organisms, how CO2 enters the ocean and impacts pH, why CO2 can remain in solution
easily in the ocean, what happens when the balance of CO2 is disrupted in the ocean, how it impacts Calcium Carbonate fixing organisms such as pteropods,
and predict how this impacts the global food web.

    in November 2012. Mrs. Gillean is going to Northern Alaska from May 30, 2013 – June 27, 2013 to participate in a PolarTREC research expedition at Toolik
    Research Station in conjunction with the University of Alaska. She will work with a team of five scientists to monitor the daily habits of arctic ground
    squirrels.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
While in San Antonio, Texas in April 2013 for a TAS Alumni Meeting, Mrs. Gillean met fellow alumna,&lt;a href="http://teacheratsea.noaa.gov/2011/fox.html"&gt;Cat Fox&lt;/a&gt;. Mrs. Fox sailed aboard the &lt;em&gt;Oscar Dyson&lt;/em&gt; in 2011, resulting in her    &lt;a href="http://teacheratsea.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/blueworld014.jpg"&gt;Adventures in a Blue World &lt;/a&gt;cartoon series that highlights her TAS
    experience. Mrs. Gillean told the TAS Alumni during the meeting that she would soon be traveling to Northern Alaska to study arctic ground squirrels, so
    Mrs. Fox drew a cartoon arctic ground squirrel that resulted in the “Inter-Species Exchange Program”.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    In this Inter-Species Exchange Program, Mrs. Gillean travels from Oklahoma to the Arctic and Mrs. Fox’s cartoon arctic ground squirrel heads to Oklahoma
and anywhere else it decides to travel. Once the    &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0BxEmTMvFJfCVdXhxYmpkRHRCVnM/edit?usp=sharing"&gt;squirrel cartoon is downloaded &lt;/a&gt;anyone can take him on an

    her &lt;a href="http://www.polartrec.com/expeditions/arctic-ground-squirrel-studies/journals/2013-04-18"&gt;PolarTREC blog&lt;/a&gt; so that everyone can see where the

    Elementary School in Woodbridge, VA. She was aboard NOAA Ship &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.moc.noaa.gov/ra/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Rainier&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;for 18
    days in August while scientists conducted hydrographic surveys to map the seafloor and coastline in Alaskan waters.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Rita presented her experience at sea on June 22 at NOAA’s National Satellite Observation Center for NOAA’s National Environmental Satellite, Data, and
    Information Service (NESDIS) &lt;a href="http://www.nesdis.noaa.gov/AboutNESDIS.html"&gt;http://www.nesdis.noaa.gov/AboutNESDIS.html&lt;/a&gt; to a group of young
    children.

    and Rita, along with NOAA Teacher at Sea staff members, explained and demonstrated how a Turtle Excluder Device (TED) works. The children also learned
    about buoys and got to build and test their own buoys!

    A group of sixth and seventh grade students at Capital City Public Charter School in Washington D.C. got a special visit from NOAA marine mammal biologist
Dave Withrow on February 22, 2012. Rebecca Kimport, a 2010 NOAA Teacher at Sea Alumna    &lt;a href="http://teacheratsea.noaa.gov/2010/kimport/index.html"&gt;http://teacheratsea.noaa.gov/2010/kimport/index.html&lt;/a&gt; welcomed Mr. Withrow to present his
    experience with “Operation Breakthrough,” a 1988 international effort to rescue three gray whales from being trapped in ice near Point Barrow, Alaska.
    Students recently completed an Oceanography unit and asked Mr. Withrow excellent questions. The same group of students was also invited to attend a private
    screening of the movie, &lt;em&gt;Big Miracle&lt;/em&gt;, by the Motion Picture Association of America on March 8.

    Dr. William B. Driggers and Kristin Hannan, research fisheries biologists with NOAA, visited NOAA Teacher at Sea Alumna, Jennifer Goldner and 150 fifth
    grade students at Jay Upper Elementary School in Jay, OK on May 9, 2012.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Jennifer Goldner first met Dr. Driggers and Ms. Hannan while she was on NOAA Ship &lt;em&gt;Oregon II &lt;/em&gt;in August 2011 as a NOAA Teacher at Sea. Both
    scientists helped Ms. Goldner generate ideas to help her students learn more about ocean life. They helped her fill her journal with facts about sharks
    along with lessons to implement in the classroom. After a year-long collaboration, Ms. Goldner, her fifth grade students, Dr. Driggers and Ms. Hannan
    produced a scientifically accurate Shark Alphabet coloring book. While at Jay Upper Elementary, Dr. Driggers and Ms. Hannan shared information about sharks
    with the students and signed copies of their Shark Alphabet coloring books.
