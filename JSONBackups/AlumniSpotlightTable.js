It's a topic that always captures the attention of high school\n    students and one for which I already have a lot of enthusiasm, and I felt that a trip to see the active volcanoes on the Big Island would give me some fun\n    first hand experiences to share with my students.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\n    Your focus was geology/earth science. How did you use your experience in the classroom and community when you returned?\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\n    Because I made the trip with a fellow Earth Science teacher, we had several goals in mind with respect to ways in which we could share the experience with\n    our students and the community. Our blog was a way to share the trip as it happened with family and friends, and current and future students can read about\n    it as well. We took hundreds of photos, so when I teach about volcanoes, I can use my own images instead of downloaded photos, and we hope to use some of\n    them to create a virtual field trip for our students. We had fun coming up with and performing simple experiments to demonstrate the change in air pressure\n    with altitude as we drove to the top of Mauna Kea. This is a concept that can be difficult for students to understand. Now we have photos of balloons that\n    expanded as we ascended, soda bottles that compressed on descent, and we even recorded the change in tire pressure. We visited several different types of\n    beaches to do a comparison of sand compositions around the island. We also made weather observations throughout the trip and photographed the different\n    climate zones we encountered as we made our way across the island. There really wasn't a day when we didn't do something with our Earth Science classes in\n    mind. Later this year, we will give a talk for the general public at the local library.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\n    The FELS grant was started in 2000 with parents of present and past Lincoln-Sudbury High School students who were deeply grateful to the professional staff\n    for their unflagging dedication, tireless effort and genuine care that they routinely offer their students.

It consists of a surface buoy about the size of a beach ball, a drogue, which acts like a sea anchor\n    and is attached underwater to the buoy by a 15 meter long tether. The drifter has a transmitter that sends data to passing satellites which provides\n    latitude and longitude of the drifter’s locations.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\n    Ms. Cullumber’s students designed stickers that were used to decorate the buoy. The stickers have messages about the school, Arizona and NOAA so that if\n    the buoy is ever retrieved this will provide information about who launched it. In the upcoming year, students will track the buoy from the satellite-based\n    system Argos that is used to collect and process drifter data.\n\u003c/p\u003e",
