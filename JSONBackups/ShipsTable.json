Scuba diving operations play a major role in scientific operations, and HI'IALAKAI is well suited to support both shallow and deep-water dive projects. The ship is equipped to carry five small work boats for transporting divers to and from working areas, dive lockers to store scientific gear and equipment, and an air compressor to fill tanks. The ship also carries a 3-person, double-lock recompression chamber; in the event of a diving accident, the diver can be treated on site.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHi’ialakai\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e carries out most of its dive intensive operations in the Northwest Hawaiian Islands.  These islands and their waters were declared a Marine National Monument in 2006.  The \u003ca href=\"http://hawaiireef.noaa.gov/\"\u003ePapahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument\u003c/a\u003e is one of the largest marine conservation areas in the world. It encompasses 139,797 square miles of the Pacific Ocean - an area larger than all the country's national parks combined. The extensive coral reefs found in Papahanaumokuakea - truly the rainforests of the sea - are home to over 7,000 marine species, one quarter of which are found only in the Hawaiian Archipelago. Many of the islands and shallow water environments are important habitats for rare species such as the threatened green sea turtle and the endangered Hawaiian monk seal.  Papahanaumokuakea is also of great cultural importance to Native Hawaiians with significant cultural sites found on the islands of Nihoa and Mokumanamana.\u003c/p\u003e"
