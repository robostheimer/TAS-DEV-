As the unforeseen sometimes occurs, ship departure and arrival dates are never guaranteed. In fact, sailing can never be guaranteed. We\n    highly recommend that you clear your calendar the week before and after a cruise to avoid any problems with your own schedule in case of a sailing delay.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n   \u003cstrong\u003e Fortitude\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\n    Life on a working ship is not for the faint of heart. The hours can be long, and the work can be dirty. Work shifts on some ships may be 4 hours on/4 hours\n    off, 6 hours on/6 hours off, or most commonly, 12 hours on/12 hours off. You may also be required to work a night shift, which for some may be quite\n    difficult to adjust to. Some cruises, especially fisheries cruises, require high-intensity work that demands physical adeptness and endurance.

Those working in any capacity on a government\n    vessel are under the ultimate command of the ship's Commanding Officer (CO). In order to maintain safety and structure, those who board NOAA ships (and\n    partner chartered ships), must be willing to follow the orders of the CO.

As the unforeseen sometimes occurs, ship departure and arrival dates are never guaranteed. In fact, sailing can never be guaranteed. We\n    highly recommend that you clear your calendar the week before and after a cruise to avoid any problems with your own schedule in case of a sailing delay.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n   \u003cstrong\u003e Fortitude\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\n    Life on a working ship is not for the faint of heart. The hours can be long, and the work can be dirty. Work shifts on some ships may be 4 hours on/4 hours\n    off, 6 hours on/6 hours off, or most commonly, 12 hours on/12 hours off. You may also be required to work a night shift, which for some may be quite\n    difficult to adjust to. Some cruises, especially fisheries cruises, require high-intensity work that demands physical adeptness and endurance. If you do\n    not feel you have the fortitude for this, this may not be the program for you.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e    The Ability to Follow Orders\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\n    Another important factor with regard to your participation in this program is your ability to follow orders.
