It is a very quick way to get this quantitative data.  A sub sample is also taken on each dredge by taking a portion of each basket and compiling it into a smaller container and counted.  In these sub-samples I counted Astropecten americanus, crabs, and whelks.  The reason for counting these species is to look at the populations of the sea scallop’s predators.  This is a very important factor in analyzing the population of a species.\"\u003c/p\u003e"},"gsx$blogtitle":{"$t":"Sherie Gee: Scalloping Across the Seafloor, June 28, 2013"},"gsx$relatedterm":{"$t":"mouse"},"gsx$collection":{"$t":"Scallops, Marine Life"}},{"id":{"$t":"https://spreadsheets.google.com/feeds/list/0Ak_vKEBczgcYdDdoTkZFb0lMMVUzdzFBOUZaWllxeUE/od6/public/values/clrrx"},"updated":{"$t":"2015-01-29T13:28:29.464Z"},"category":[{"scheme":"http://schemas.google.com/spreadsheets/2006","term":"http://schemas.google.com/spreadsheets/2006#list"}],"title":{"type":"text","$t":"1/1/2013"},"content":{"type":"text","$t":"originalphotourl: http://teacheratsea.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/dyk51.jpg, pdf: /dyk/DYK-51.pdf, photourl: http://teacheratsea.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/dyk_txt51.jpg, shortdescription: A scientist stands on the sorting table and distributes the catch to others who will sort it into buckets., blogurl: http://teacheratsea.wordpress.com/2013/07/30/virginia-warren-adios-ciao-shalom-arrivederci-adieu-auf-weidersehen-in-other-words-goodbye-for-now-july-17-2013/, photocaption: Shoveling, photocredit: Virginia Warren (2013), photodescription: \u003cp\u003e\"Somebody always has to get on top of the sorting table to shovel the dredge contents around to the those who are doing the sorting.\"\u003c/p\u003e, blogtitle: Virginia Warren: Adios, Ciao, Shalom, Arrivederci, Adieu, Auf Weidersehen, in other words Goodbye for Now, July 17, 2013, relatedterm: sorting, collection: Scallops, Marine Lfie"},"link":[{"rel":"self","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"https://spreadsheets.google.com/feeds/list/0Ak_vKEBczgcYdDdoTkZFb0lMMVUzdzFBOUZaWllxeUE/od6/public/values/clrrx"}],"gsx$publishdate":{"$t":"1/1/2013"},"gsx$originalphotourl":{"$t":"http://teacheratsea.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/dyk51.jpg"},"gsx$pdf":{"$t":"/dyk/DYK-51.pdf"},"gsx$photourl":{"$t":"http://teacheratsea.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/dyk_txt51.jpg"},"gsx$shortdescription":{"$t":"A scientist stands on the sorting table and distributes the catch to others who will sort it into buckets."},"gsx$blogurl":{"$t":"http://teacheratsea.wordpress.com/2013/07/30/virginia-warren-adios-ciao-shalom-arrivederci-adieu-auf-weidersehen-in-other-words-goodbye-for-now-july-17-2013/"},"gsx$photocaption":{"$t":"Shoveling"},"gsx$photocredit":{"$t":"Virginia Warren (2013)"},"gsx$photodescription":{"$t":"\u003cp\u003e\"Somebody always has to get on top of the sorting table to shovel the dredge contents around to the those who are doing the sorting.\"\u003c/p\u003e"},"gsx$blogtitle":{"$t":"Virginia Warren: Adios, Ciao, Shalom, Arrivederci, Adieu, Auf Weidersehen, in other words Goodbye for Now, July 17, 2013"},"gsx$relatedterm":{"$t":"sorting"},"gsx$collection":{"$t":"Scallops, Marine Lfie"}},{"id":{"$t":"https://spreadsheets.google.com/feeds/list/0Ak_vKEBczgcYdDdoTkZFb0lMMVUzdzFBOUZaWllxeUE/od6/public/values/cyevm"},"updated":{"$t":"2015-01-29T13:28:29.464Z"},"category":[{"scheme":"http://schemas.google.com/spreadsheets/2006","term":"http://schemas.google.com/spreadsheets/2006#list"}],"title":{"type":"text","$t":"7/10/2014"},"content":{"type":"text","$t":"originalphotourl: http://teacheratsea.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/dyk411.jpg, pdf: /dyk/DYK-4.pdf, photourl: http://teacheratsea.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/dyk_txt4.jpg, shortdescription: Scientists empty the contents of a scallop dredge onto a sorting table on the ship’s deck., blogurl: http://teacheratsea.wordpress.com/2012/06/17/janet-nelson-third-day-at-sea-june-17-2012/, photocaption: Scallops, photocredit: Janet Nelson, photodescription: \u003cp\u003e“Every time the net is hauled onto the table, we sort every item that has been pulled up from the ocean.

The scientists ready the nets by attaching cod ends and making note of the data that tracks the flow of water through the net.  Because the nets are large and heavy, and because of the strong pressure of the water flowing through the nets, they are lifted into the water using winches that are operated by the ship’s crew.  The crew members operate the machinery, and guide the nets over the side of the ship.  While this is happening, the crew members communicate by radio with the Bridge, providing them with information about the angle of the cable that is attached to the net, so that the Bridge can maintain the a speed that will keep the net at the correct angle. At the same time, a scientist in the dry lab monitors how deep the net is and communicates with the deck crew about when to raise and lower the nets.

Weather conditions, possible hazards, and the daily assignment for each launch are discussed. Per the instructions on the POD (Plan of the Day), handed out the previous evening, the crew then disperse to their assigned launches. The launches are then one-at-a-time lowered into the water by the fancy davit machinery and driven away by the coxswain to their specific “polygon” or survey area for the day. A polygon surveyed by a launch on average takes 2-3 hours at 6-8 knots to survey and usually is an area that is inaccessible by the ship. Many polygons make up one large area called a “sheet” which is under the direction of the “sheet manager”. Several sheets make up an entire survey project.
